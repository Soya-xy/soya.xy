h1>Hey, I'm Soya. I'm a Front End Developer in China. I love building open-sourceProjects and Writing about what I learn. This website is my digital gardenâ€”a compendium of the things I've learned and created over the years.

My site has no ads, no affiliate links, no tracking or analytics, no sponsored posts, and no paywall. My only motivation for this site is to share what I've learned with the world and document notes for myself, and hopefully connect with a few people.

Check out the projects page to see a highlight of the open-source projects I've made, and articles to see everything I've written. I've also written external publications for DigitalOcean, Envato Tuts+, etc. and done a few speaking engagements and podcasts, which you can find below.
