Hey, I'm Tania! I'm a software engineer working in Chicago. Welcome to my spot on the web for projects I've created, tutorials I've written, musings, and anything else I want to show the world.

My site has no ads, no affiliate links, no tracking or analytics, no sponsored posts, and no paywall. My only motivation for this site is to share what I've learned with the world and document notes for myself, and hopefully connect with a few people.

Check out the projects page to see a highlight of the open-source projects I've made, and articles to see everything I've written. I've also written external publications for DigitalOcean, Envato Tuts+, etc. and done a few speaking engagements and podcasts, which you can find below.

Tania writes extremely clear, concise tutorials. It's no exaggeration to say that I wouldn't currently have a job in development without this site. So thanks for ruining my life, Tania.
